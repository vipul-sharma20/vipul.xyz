### Initiating bi-weekly journal

I had planned to start writing more last year. This is the first of hopefully
many journals I'll write. I'll be posting about things I learned, read, working
on etc.

### 2021-01-31
- I have been reading _"Introducing MLOps"_ by Mark Treveil, the Dataiku team. ISBN: 978-1-49208-329-0.
    - I have not completed it yet.
    - Till now the author has talked about why MLOps has been developed as a
      discipline and the kind of people involved to execute MLOps successfully.
      They have also talked about MLOps considerations at each stage of the ML
      lifecycle (development, deploying to production, monitoring and
      governance).
