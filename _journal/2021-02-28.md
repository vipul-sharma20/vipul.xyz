#### Writing an original composition

I am trying to work on an OC track more on it in my post, ["On writing an

#### Reading for MLOps

- [Machine Learning: The high-interest credit card of technical debt.][ml-ops1]
- [Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems.][ml-ops2]
- [What’s your ML test score? A rubric for ML production systems][ml-ops3]
