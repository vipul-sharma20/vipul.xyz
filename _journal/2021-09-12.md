At my work, we tried creating personal [OKRs][OKR] to have personal milestones for the
quarter in addition to framing our company/team's OKRs.

Below is a snippet of one of the personal OKR I had set for myself in Q1 2021.

It started of well, wrote 3 posts as planned (fortnightly each). I got a little
too carried away by my success of achieving an insane 3 posts streak but then
stopped writing regular posts after that. I believe that because I publicized
that I'll be writing these posts bi-weekly in Q1 2021, I felt obligated to
achieve it.

<p style="text-align: center;font-size:0.7em;margin-top: -20px">Excerpt from my
first journal <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/journal/2021-01-31/">post</a>
(didn't age well)</p>

Now I have set writing goals for myself. ***Sunday afternoon writing***. Every
Sunday, I'll write something I learned during at my work, hobby projects, life
experiences etc.

## Resurrection, behind the scenes: *[midi-macro][midi-macro]*

One of the reasons why I felt more driven to do regular writing was because of
the recent activities on my project, [midi-macro][midi-macro]. It's a project
which allows you to configure a [MIDI controller][midi-controller] and use it
as a macro pad. So if you have a 61 keys MIDI controller, you essentially have
a 61 key macro pad (may sound very counter productive or not much useful, and I
concur). This was a one evening weekend project and I left working on it and
didn't bother writing about it. I am working on it again, and will make a post
about the project soon.

There were a few PRs on the repository by people who made some really nice
additions and fixes to it. One person used it for some image processing tasks
by configuring *[darktable][darktable]* to be controllable with the MIDI
controller knobs: [https://tfager.github.io/midimacro/](https://tfager.github.io/midimacro/).

I realized that I do have things to talk about if I commit to write more
frequently. This being one of those instances where I could've talked about a
weekend project in my blog posts.

So in summary, resurrected an old project and this journal.
