## Learning from interviews

We have interviewed quite a few people for Software Engineering role at
[Skit][skit]. In 2019-2020, we had a lot of applicants who were straight out of
college or around 1 year of experience.

Recently, we have been interviewing a little more experienced bunch of people
(around 2-6 years of experience)<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> and I could see the
difference in the kind of discussions I have had with them vs people with 1-2
YOE.

For new graduates, most of the discussions have been more like a checklist of
questions, if they clear those, they are through. However, I try to discuss
more on people's work rather than going through a set of right or wrong
questions as much as possible. This gives a better understanding of their skill
as an Engineer. But in absence of hobby projects or internships, only way to
evaluate some language skill is to go through a list of language proficiency
questions.

I interviewed at Razorpay in late 2017 and in one of the tech rounds, the
interviewer asked me to just talk about any programming language concept I
want. I talked about internals of GIL in Python, how it works internally, and
how its implementation has changed since Python3.2 in contrast to how it was
before. I liked this discussion a lot, it was more of a learning session for
both the interviewer and me, and we discussed about it for about 45 minutes. In
my previous company's ([DriveU][driveu]) interview, I had a 30 minutes
discussion with the VP of Engineering about our vimrc files.

People like to talk about what they are passionate for, it's a great way to
assess to what depths they can go for the things they like. If they like the
work we are doing at the company, we could see them replicating the same at
work. This is something which I now actively try to look for irrespective of
the years of experience they have.

Interviews are already a little intimidating, we don't do any DS/Algorithm
questions. Unless we start building our own database, I don't think we need to
ask how to build a B+ tree because that's not the kind of skill we need right
now. For any candidate this is the workflow I follow:

- Do a 15-20 minutes read through of the resume and projects (if shared).
- Make a list of questions I would like to discuss more on based on their
  projects or current work. For example: One person had worked on an in-house
  load testing framework so I was curious to discuss on:
    - How did they do load simulation: concurrency, real user scenarios etc.?
    - What exactly they were trying to test and monitor? correctness, response
      times, hardware logistics etc.
- Get on the call.
- Keep a notebook and try to create a map of their work. I try to create a
  basic block diagram of the projects people talk about based on their
  explanation and then do QnA on them to understand the hows and whys.
- A significant amount of time is spent on talking about the company, culture,
  the people etc.

It's interesting to see how people's way of approaching a problem is influenced
by their current job. For example, in a hypothetical scenario to send thousands
of concurrent HTTP requests in Python, some people might choose a message queue
which they had recently worked with. Not commenting anything on whether it's
right or wrong. But, I feel it could be concerning if you start considering
these approaches as conventions. Talking to people, and understanding the
varied kind of solutions and the thought processes they have for similar
problem statement, I learnt that I am also in a bubble of certain philosophies
and thought process which is being influenced by the people I work with. I feel
it's important for me to go out and learn from other people's experience more
often than I do right now.

## Building my own Lily58 split keyboard

I had built a mechanical keyboard early this year. More about it at:
[https://vipul.xyz/random/building-mechanical-keyboard/][mechanical-keyboard].
It was more like assembling individually ordered components together: keyboard
kit, key switches and keycaps. I feel I will definitely build a few mechanical
keyboards in my lifetime.

This split keyboard which I am trying to build is as hardcore as it can get,
getting a PCB, diodes, some Arduino stuff. TBH, I don't know how it works, I am
not an electronics person but I am learning with this.  It's a [Lily58][lily58]
split keyboard and I always wanted to try out a split keyboard. I might have to
get used this split layout which would take some time.

I don't have much soldering experience. Behold, my work of art.

Here's a small time lapse video of me soldering the tiniest thing ever I have
worked with.

Look at the size of this diode!

</div>

It's difficult to procure keyboard parts, I can't even find Cherry MX key
switches on online stores. I might have to use the key switches I have in my
current keyboard to test this out (or look at some Chinese online store). I
hope it turns out well in the end and the thing works. Either ways, I'll make a
post on how I built or messed up my split keyboard depending on how it turns
out. 

## Some artists I like

I like the music by [Josh Turner][josh-turner], [Reina del Cid][reina-del-cid],
[Carson McKee][carson-mckee] and [Tony Lindgren][tony-lindgren]. They have
collaborated a lot together and I love their original compositions. I have been
following their work since 2016 and I have come across a lot of different
artists because their covers and their musical influences.

I came across an OC by Reina del Cid today morning (she has collaborated with
Josh on this one) called, [What I'm
Losing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=430qMTESTVk).

I like the beautiful opening chord progression and I tried to record a 30
seconds excerpt from it:

   people have exhibited the skills and values we are looking for, YOE is
   secondary._
