I am not a traveller. I sometimes suffer with motion sickness
even when I am on a cab ride. This is one reason why I
don't travel a lot. Did a 1:30 hour ferry ride today, I think
the anti nausea pill saved me. I can go for hours talking
about my other experiences.

This is the 2nd time this year I have taken time off for
a vacation with friends. I don't want to break my streak of
weekly posts so I am quickly posting this by editing markdown on
GitHub through my phone. I like I can glide type all this
with one hand.

I have been trying to upload a photo since last 30 minutes
but looks like this flaky 200 Kbps internet can't do it.
I guess this post will have nothing of significance but just
a filler post for my streak.
