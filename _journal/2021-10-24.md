## OOO

I was out of office on a trip to Andaman 2 weeks ago. I posted an anime [filler
like post 2 weeks ago][filler-post] just to keep my streak of weekly blog posts
going but missed out on posting last week because I got sick right after I
returned. I tried really hard to not miss my streak but I couldn't make myself
to write last Sunday.

First impression of Andaman, really nice people. Every person we talked to was
super nice and helpful which doesn't happen with me very often.

Havelock</p>

I was impressed that Havelock, with a population of around 6,000 people was
reasonably well accessible. Internet was slow but not non-existent. We were
short of cash and conveniently there was an ATM nearby which was working.
Thanks SBI.

I saw a beach for the first time in 2018 in Goa and now I have visited
Radhanagar Beach which is apparently [ranked as the 8th best beach in the
world][radhanagar-rank]. As self proclaimed beach connoisseur, I would say it
was pretty nice.

TBH, this picture doesn't do the justice. It's one of those
_you-had-to-be-there_ experience. I'll leave usage of all the unheard
adjectives for this place to the travel bloggers out there.

## Playing Music

I used to be some what regular posting guitar covers etc. on [my
Instagram][instagram] (in 2019 mostly) but not so much these days. One thing I
like about posting is the practice you go through to record any piece. You need
to record multiple times to get the cover just right and during the course of
these iterations you perfect the pieces.

I usually pick what I want to learn, practice on Saturdays and record on
Sundays. If the track is too difficult for me, I wait and practice for another
week and then record (most of the times it's just 1 more Saturday practice).

This is something which I was practicing this Saturday:

<div style="text-align: center">
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/audios/slow-dancing-practice.aac" type="audio/aac">
</audio>
</div>

This was my first time playing this song. Clearly struggling.

Below is what I recorded today after practicing a lot yesterday and today.

<div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 10px">
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g7ixkujCPMk" title="YouTube video
player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

TBH, I think it's pretty average and not too great.

- You can hear some strings ringing at multiple places which shouldn't.
- Notes at some places are not clean during transitions or slides.
- Would've liked smoother transitions, more fluid. It sounds straight out of
  some tutorial and doesn't seem to have a soul to it.
- Audio quality is not too good. Should've normalized the audio properly.

I had a personal goal for myself to practice 20 hours every month. Very doable.
I did make some effort on it but couldn't continue it for long or atleast I
stopped measuring these practice hours. I wonder if it's even the right way to
make yourself commit more. Sometimes you play for a few hours in a go and
sometimes you don't play for days.

I usually dabble around these days, play on some backing track or record
something on loop and jam on top of it (I highly recommend buying a loop pedal
to anyone). Thanks to WFH that I could do this.
