This is not a usual journal post talking about my past week. At this point,
these weekly posts are not even weekly journals but straight up general blog
posts. Will think about organizing them better.

I have a list of posts which I want to write over the next few weeks. A few of
them are about the projects I have been working on and a few are some general
topics I would like to write on.

## Potential blog posts 

### 1. midi-macro

I am working on improving the [midi-macro][midi-macro] package. Adding a few
more features, better abstraction for macro plugins etc. Also, I am planning to
buy small cheap midi pad controller and use it as a macro pad.

this but smaller</p>


### 2. Slate: Slack standup bot

Slack app for standup which we use at [Skit][skit]. Planning to make a proper
release of this project, maybe post it on Product Hunt, Reddit and a post about
what has happened since the last [post][slack-standup-scribble].

### 3. Made-in-x: 1 year update post

It's been 1 year since I wrote a post on [made-in-x][made-in-x], where I
plotted the country of origin of a few of the products that I own. I had the
plots updated for a while but for the last few months, it's been a little
stale.

I want to post on what has changed in the last one year: a diff/comparison
between the original plot and the past year, identify anything interesting in
the kind of products bought, source of purchase etc. maybe better plots?

### 4. Neovim lua config

I have been using my Vimscript based config with the latest Neovim as well which
now has Lua runtime support embedded with it (in version 0.4 and above).

A lot of people have started writing plugins in Lua and I have also [tried my
hands on it][lua-plugins]. I have also started to port my configs to Lua. Neovim
hasn't dropped and won't drop support for Vimscript but for the sake of
consistency and future proofing my configs, I am porting it to Lua.

Planning to write a post on my experience working with Vimscript vs Lua and the
migration journey.

### 5. Task management/tracking workflow

I'll write about my workflow for task management and tracking here. I have a few
tools which I have been using for a few years now and a few which I have
recently adopted. I have seen a lot of nice posts on people talking about their
workflow and how they work, I am also planning to document my workflow in a blog
post.

### 6. Vim + GitHub Copilot

Thanks to the "Vim plugin artist", [tpope][tpope], there's now a vim plugin for
[GitHub Copilot][copilot]. Installed it 2 days back and haven't tried it much to
comment on it. But I'll surely be writing about my experience with it in a few
weeks.

PS: A few senteces in this post were completed by Copilot which is kinda good
and bad.

### 7. Vim Bengaluru

Organizing a meetup for vi/vim/neovim enthusiasts of Bengaluru: [Vim
Bengaluru][vim-bengaluru]. The first meetup is planned to happen sometime in mid
November. Will post about the experiences in the meetup and more.

### 8. Split keyboard update

I had posted about building my first split keyboard [here][split-keyboard] a
few weeks back. However, I have not fully completed it yet. I don't have all
the parts to finish it and the only options to get them are either via cheap
Chinese vendor or some expensive European or US store with high Indian customs
charges.

Hopefully, in the next 2 months, I'll get the missing pieces and have an
update.
