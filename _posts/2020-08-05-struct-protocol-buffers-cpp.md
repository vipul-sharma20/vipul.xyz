`Struct` type documentation at: [https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#struct][0]

Example proto file:
```proto
import "google/protobuf/struct.proto";

message Config {
  google.protobuf.Struct metadata = 1;
}
```

C++ implementation:
```cpp
::google::protobuf::Value value;
value.set_string_value("value");

auto fields = config->mutable_metadata()->mutable_fields();

(*fields)["key"] = value;
```
