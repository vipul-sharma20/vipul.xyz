## About

I made an application for Slack based standups. This is a Flask server
application to handle Slack callbacks, create/submit standups, report to a
channel etc.

Check usage and API in the README of the [repository][0].

Most of the Slack based standup applications are paid. The one which we used in
Vernacular.ai used to be free but then they converted into a per-user pricing.
I wanted to make our own Slack standup application which we can host ourselves
so I made this over a weekend.
