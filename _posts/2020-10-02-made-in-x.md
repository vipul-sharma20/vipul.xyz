## About

I have plotted the country of origin of a few of the products that I currently
own.

**Edit (2021-11-28)**: Part 2 of this post is [here][made-in-x-part2].

## Why?

One day, I noticed that my nail clipper is "made in Korea" (manufactured by
Bell). I am sure a lot of you would've noticed that you have nail clippers that
are made in Korea. I found an interesting article titled:

[Every thing is "Made in China" but nail clippers/cutters are from S.Korea, Why
though ??][0]

This gave me an idea to log the country of origin of the products I own. I
couldn't log the data for **all** the products I own, but I have tried to cover
a few categories.

Over the past few weeks, I've collected data for 80+ products across various
categories (check the categories in the plots below).

To source the data, I looked for straight up *"made in x"* label on the items,
old boxes of the products, online order history and in some cases, looked up on
the internet for the country of manufacturing for a brand.

## Made in X

Here is a plot of the product categories and the countries they are
manufactured in.

* Interesting to see that most of the electronics is manufactured in China
  whereas the electrical products are manufactured in India.
* Almost all the clothing items are made in India which includes some well
  known brands.
* Only USA made products are the music products like guitar strings and some
  accessories

## Where I got these products from?

I also collected data of where I purchased these items from. Below is the plot
which shows how I purchased/got these products.

* Amazon.in seems to be the go to online shopping for me.
* The 2 purchases from Flipkart were made only because they were exclusively
  available on Flipkart.
