I am marking this as the start for my [100DaysToOffload][100DaysToOffload]
challenge.

My last post was in July, 2023. I have been wanting to write more about various
things like my side projects, some hobby stuff I picked up, etc. but always
held myself from posting things out. I would like to post even some of the not
so refined pieces of work. I don't expect people to read them all or learn from
them but form a discipline of writing and publishing something.

I had made 2 attempts previously to publish [weekly journals][journal] that
worked for around 1 & 2 months respectively. Looking at the past failures, even
maintaining a streak for weekly journaling again might be difficult. As of
writing this post, there are 40 weeks remaining in the year. So I have already
took up a challenge that requires more commitment than my past 2 attempts.
Considering the things that are coming up ahead in the year for me, I will be really happy if I could maintain a good streak of posts.

Some of the themes I would like to cover in my future posts are below (in no particular order)

### 6 years at Skit.ai

Today (26th March), when I am writing this post, I complete 6 years at [Skit.ai][skit.ai].

I should have good amount of experiences, stories, learnings, etc. to share
from ~~the last 6 years~~ more than half a decade (saying this way sounds
cooler) working at Skit.ai.

### 3d Printing

I bought a 3d printer in February 2023. I would like to create a catalogue of
stuff that I have printed.

### Raspberry Pi + Self hosted

I have been building a few side projects on my 3 Raspberry Pis (Model 3, 4 &
5). A few are some home automation things and a few are some self hosted
solutions hosted on these Pis.

### Side Projects

These are some small weekend side projects that I have worked on in the last
year. Some of them can be good to write about I believe

### Note Taking

I have been experimenting with some alternate note taking approaches. I have
written about my [note taking approach][note-taking] once before. I have tried
working with Obsidian and Logseq but I keep coming back to Vimwiki. I would
like to write about it again.

### Music Posts

I have not been playing or practicing as much as I would like to. However, I
would like to post about some of the pieces I am practicing, my motivation
behind those or maybe some of the practice session recordings. 

### Mini Posts

I would like to publish small piece of write up as posts. They could be like
some TIL type things, some productivity hack or something. I don't know how
I'll do this like as a separate page in this blog or as a first class blog
post.

These are not the only things I'll post about. There are 99 more posts to go.
I'll definitely get some more themes to write about as I write in the next few
months
