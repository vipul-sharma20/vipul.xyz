## 3D Printing

I have been into 3D printing since the last 1.5 years. I have loads of things
to write about it, showcase some of the prints that I have done, etc. For now,
I just want to quickly post about one of the small utility that I built for one
of my recent project.

## GitHub Skyline

[GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) is a 3D visual
representation of your GitHub contributions over the past year, rendered as a
cityscape. It provides a way to download STLs for each year that you can 3D
print yourself.

As of writing this, GitHub skyline is not functional anymore. Fortunately, I
have got a local backup of all the 3D STLs since the start of my GitHub
account.

## [threedee][threedee]

GitHub provides skyline / 3D STL only for a specific year. Below is how a
single year skyline looks like.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pl19NEo.png" alt="stl" style="width:700px;"/>
<p style="text-align:center;padding:5px;font-size:0.7em;margin-top:5px;margin-left:25px;margin-right:15px">My (<a href="https://github.com/vipul-sharma20">vipul-sharma20</a>) 2021 GitHub Skyline</p>
</div>

I have built a script that can take a bunch of years worth of STL files, stack
them together in order of year, in a calendar like style (5x2 matrix from
2014-2023).

I have built [threedee][threedee], a 3D printing utility CLI for myself to add
any modifications that I would require to make to 3D models programmatically.
One of the work I have done here is to work with GitHub skyline designs and
create a single model combining 10 years of contribution in a matrix like print.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/vipul-sharma20/427bcd96d9899906ff6ca2dd40ba3421#github.stl)
is the interactive view of the skyline of my last 10 years of GitHub
contributions.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qnjRL0D.png" alt="stl" style="width:700px;"/>
<p style="text-align:center;padding:5px;font-size:0.7em;margin-top:5px;margin-left:25px;margin-right:15px">10 years of contributions in 5x2 matrix. Check <a href="https://gist.github.com/vipul-sharma20/427bcd96d9899906ff6ca2dd40ba3421#github.stl">here</a> for a better / more interactive view</p>
</div>
