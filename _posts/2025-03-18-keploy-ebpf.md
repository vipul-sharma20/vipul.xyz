I am working on setting up [Keploy][keploy] at work to generate unit tests for
one of the runtime component at Skit.ai

For general use cases on linux, Keploy works as below

```
keploy record -c "python main.py"
```

I discovered that on MacOS, Keploy works by containerizing the application. So
it needs to work something as below

```
keploy record -c "docker run --name test -p 8080:8080 image:tag" --container-name test --buildDelay 30
```

I faced some SSL handshake issues while running it this way that I didn't face
while running the application server normally i.e. without Keploy.

After this I planned to run a linux container and run everything inside that
i.e. entire dev setup, application server, keploy etc.

I noticed that I was getting the below error

```

```

After this, I learnt about [eBPF][ebpf].

MacOS doesn't have support for eBPF. However, there's one userspace
implementation of eBPF, [uBPF][ubpf] that I'll try next.
