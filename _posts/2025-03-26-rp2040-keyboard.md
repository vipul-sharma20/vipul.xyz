I am planning to use an RP2040 Pro Micro for my next keyboard build.

I am using this specifically to use MicroPython or CircuitPython based
firmwares ([KMK][kmk] or something else) or just building something myself.

I have bought 2 [RP2040 Pro Micro by SparkFun][sparkfun]. These should be
direct replacements for Arduino Pro Micro. I already have some extra PCBs
printed from my [previous Lily58 build][lily58] so I can just use the same PCBs
to build a new keyboard using these microcontrollers
