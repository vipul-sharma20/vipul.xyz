## Projects

- Building [Lily58][lily58] using RP2040 with MicroPython
- Set up [Borg][borg] for all the persistent storage and data I have from
  [Immich][immich], [Open WebUI][open-webui] and other [self-hosted][self-hosted] tools
- Add [MCP][mcp] support in my own fork of [Open WebUI][open-webui] if there's
  no progress in support in upstream
- *or I may work on  something else altogether, IDK*

### Old projects
I recently tried to use my 5 years old vim plugin,
[vim-registers][vim-registers], it worked perfectly and TBH, I preferred this
more than the [Telescope's][telescope] version of listing vim registers.

I also tried to check if my other plugin still works, [vim-cricket]. It needs
some fixing and I would probably want to add a few features to make it useful
again to me.

But before this, I would really want to revive [midi-macro][midi-macro]. It's
one of my more unique kind of project and do see some utility (like a cheap
[stream deck][stream-deck] through MIDI grid controller). I saw someone made a
good use of this project [here][midi-macro-project].

## Posts

- Move TIL posts to [main blog][vipul.xyz] somewhere maybe
- Posts on the projects that I'll work that I mentioned earlier. I'll try to
  post about progress also.
- *Other usual things I'll encounter over the month*
