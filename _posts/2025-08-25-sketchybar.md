### Sketchybar

The top and bottom bars are two different instances of
[Sketchybar][sketchybar]. I customized them after referring to the 
[Author's sketchybar configs][author-config].

The bottom bar for me is kind of a health / reliability indicator. I have
configured uptime monitors for some of the third-party vendors, uptime and
active engineering team incidents of in our company

### Yabai

For window manager, I am using [Yabai][yabai]. I have been using it for 2
years.

For borders, I am using [JankyBorders][borders] which is built the same author
who built Sketchybar

Unfortunately, I don't have dotfiles to share yet. I have it version controlled
in a private repository. I need to clean things up and get them into some
structure before I can open-source it.
