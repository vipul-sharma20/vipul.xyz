Writing this post as an update on what I am working on and some backlog of
ideas that I would like to work on.

## Travel Analysis *(Currently Active)*

I am writing a post to visualize and analyze my flight travel history for the
last 9 years. I started writing this 1 month ago. It has taken me some time to
nicely structure things nicely. I wanted to do write a high quality post and
take my time. I travelled for around 12 days in the last month so it kinda
broke the flow of this work. I'll probably publish by end of this week

## Ideas Backlog

These are some ideas and backlog of work that I am currently thinking of in no
particular order. I might work on them or pickup something completely different
based on how I feel like working on later.

**1. Build a drone from scratch**

This might be a long running project which I might do on and off. Since LLMs
writing code, I am getting more inclined towards doing hardware projects.

**2. Design my own keyboard, maybe a macropad**

I [built a split keyboard][split-keyboard] last year and the only part that I
didn't do myself was the PCB design and I picked [lily58][lily58] as the base.

I want to learn the PCPB design part as well and build a complete custom
keyboard or maybe a small macropad.

**3. Finish my blog post on Prince's Showmanship that I have in draft**

I have a draft post on "Prince's Showmanship" *(tentative title)* with the
excerpt *"An analysis of Prince's Rock & Roll Hall Fame (2004) performance and
why I feel it's one of the best live guitar solos & performance (atleast for
me)"*

It'll be a commentary/analysis/feelings on [this][prince-performance] Prince's
performance.

**4. Add more posts in the Gallery page / travel logs of 2025**

I started a gallery page to log my travels in form of albums/photos with
intention of sometimes adding stories around it as posts [here][gallery-page].
I want to add a lot of posts here.

There's a meta part to it to make the workflow of adding posts/travel logs to
gallery easier from my phone. So probably some code stuff before things are
actually published here.

I tried to add 2 posts and the process was extremely slow. I need a better
and faster workflow to quickly publish this
