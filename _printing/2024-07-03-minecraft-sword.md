This [Minecraft Sword][sword] was my first 3D print when I first set up my 3D
printer more than 1.5 years ago.

I got an [Ender 3 v2 Neo][ender-3] back in February 2023. Most of the people
would try to print one of the pre-loaded design, the [3DBenchy][benchy] but I
wanted to test out the slicer and print something simpler for the first time
and for some reason, I came across an STL for this Minecraft sword.

I remember watching the printer do its thing, building layer by layer. Looking
at something come to existence like this felt really cool.

I'll be posting about more 3D prints that I have made over the last 1.5 years
in the coming days.
