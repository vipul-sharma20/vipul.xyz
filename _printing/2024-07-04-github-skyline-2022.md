[GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) is a 3D visual
representation of your GitHub contributions over the past year, rendered as a
cityscape. It provides a way to download STLs for each year that you can 3D
print yourself.

This was my 2nd 3D print from February of 2023.

As of writing this, GitHub skyline is not functional anymore. Fortunately, I
have got a local backup of all the 3D STLs since the start of my GitHub
account.
