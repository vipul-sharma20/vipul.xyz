I 3D printed map area (roughly around or less than 1km<sup>2</sup>) around my
workplace in Bengaluru.

Thanks to [Smoggy3D][smoggy3d] for building [https://map2model.com/](https://map2model.com/).

Choice of colors is not the best but I wanted to try our the filaments that I
got from Bambu Lab when I had purchased my printer. Those free/complimentary
ones are I think around 150-200gms and this print was small enough to try one
of those (the orange one) out.

I could see some stringing with the orange Bambu Lab filament that I freshly
opened for this print. I don't have a filament dryer that I could've used
before using the filament fresh out of packaging and Bengaluru's weather
doesn't help either (doesn't help 3D printing but for people, you can't
complain at all, it's quite nice). Before changing the dessicant in the AMS, I
saw my hygrometer say 50%, so it's not really good for the filaments and for
prints like these that has items spaced closed together and susceptible to
stringing.

### Timelapse

This took me 8 hours to print.
