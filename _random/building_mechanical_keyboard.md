I have been wanting to build a split keyboard for some time specifically
[lily58][lily58] Unfortunately, my first mechanical keyboard is not a split
keyboard because of various reasons. I did a custom build of a 61 keys standard
style keyboard (image and build montage below).

Disclaimer: I am still a beginner in the world of mechanical keyboards. You
might get better info/opinions on a random reddit thread (that's how I got
it)

I can see that building and buying mechanical keyboards is an expensive hobby.
Also, I could see that it's a little difficult to procure parts or even
completely manufactured keyboards in India. To be honest, I didn't do any
legwork to see if I can get parts and stuff from local vendors.

Only options I could see for the lazy me were:
- Import some manufactured keyboard which I like. This option is too expensive
  because shipping, high import duty in India etc.
- Choose among the limited set of non-out-of-stock keyboards from online
  shopping websites. The ones in stock are usually because they are non RGB,
  not really good value for money etc. You could either be patient and wait for
  re stocking, pre-order etc. I didn't do this.
- Import or find individual components. I didn't find much online in India.
  However, you could import them but again not a very cost efficient option
  because of reasons stated previously. [meckeys.com][meckeys] proved to be the
  savior in my case as I bought everything from here.

## The Build

I ordered 3 parts:

- [Barebone Kit: GK61 (RGB)][barebone_kit]
- [Cherry MX (RGB) Brown Keyswitches][keyswitches]
- [Blue and Red Pudding Keycaps][keycaps]

Assembling these pretty straightforward like putting lego blocks. Maybe a little
more careful lego block building. It took me more effort to do the stop motion
recording than assembling it. Could've easily done it in 10 minutes.

#### Keycaps Review

The Ducky pudding keycaps are pretty good quality, they are double shot PBT.
ABS ones are usually cheaper than these. The pudding style keycaps look really
good with this RGB board.

I would've bought a Ducky keyboard if I had not done this custom build. I have
heard good reviews about it.

#### Key Switches Review

Overall, I am pretty happy with the choice of my key switches. I was a little
skeptical about it since I haven't try anything other than Cherry MX Blue which
is a more tactile key switch. I definitely didn't want that and neither the
linear switches but somewhere in the middle. Turns out that Cherry MX brown is
exactly that and therefore, I ordered that.

#### The Barebone Kit

I looked around a lot and there was only this one barebone kit available for
custom builds. Overall, the board is pretty solid, strong, good finish had
decent enough instructions to set it up. The casing is built out of ABS.

Biggest drawback of this board is its offical software for configuration and
all the RGB stuff. It's really bad. From the looks of it, some people didn't
face much problems but most of the people may share the same sentiment as mine.
The software is not very intuitive and buggy. I would use factory settings than
using this software to configure anything.

[pixeltris][pixeltris] proved to be the hero we needed. He/She has made an
alternative tool which allows you to set keys, macros, and lighting for GK6X
keyboards (this keyboard included).
