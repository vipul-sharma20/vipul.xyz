## About

I had a portable HDD and a raspberry pi lying around so I used them to create
Netfork File System in my local home network.

I use a Macbook Air as my dev machine which has served me well for 2.5+ years
now. One big problem I have is the storage. It has a 128GB SSD and it's mostly
filled with a lot of Docker images and other work related data. The NFS server
helps a lot with the storage considering I am working from WFH for this entire
year.

I have created an interactive Shell script to setup NFS server on raspberry pi
with a USB Hard Disk.
