Hello, I am Vipul. I am a programmer based out of Bengaluru, India. I work in
the Engineering team at [Skit.ai][skit-ai]. My work involves leading and
managing the Engineering team.

I build software primarily for myself and [open-source][github] it in the hope
that it might be helpful to others.

In the recent times, I have gotten myself into [self-hosting][self-hosting],
[3D printing][threedee] and [building keyboards][keyboard]. This might be
outdated when you read this but I'll try to keep things updated with whatever I
am working on.

Throughout my school life, I was fortunate to have great Computer Science
teachers who kept my interest alive. All that led me to take up this as a field
of study and, eventually my career.

There's a special kind of satisfaction that I feel bringing things to existence
with code.

This website is a place for me to write about some of the projects that I work
on (mostly non-work related). I don't document posts of every hobby project but
I'll share whatever feels worth writing about, whenever motivation strikes.
